# You're probably no starting from scratch
The validated patterns community has relied on existing architectures that have been succesfully deployed in an enterprise. The architecture itself is a best practice in assembling technologies and projects to provide a working solution. How that solution is deployed and managed is a different matter. It may have evolved over time and may have grown in its deployment such that ongoing maintenance is not sustainable. 

The validated patterns framework is much more of a best practice of structuring the various configuration assets and integrating with GitOps and DevOps tools.

Therefore the question really is: how do I move my successful architecture solution into a sustainable GitOps/DevOps framework? And that is what we are going to do in this section.

# Moving to the validated patterns framework
*TBD This area will cover the strategies and tactics of moving to the framework with lessons learned from experts.*

## Operators to framework

## Scripts to framework

## Ansible to Framework

## Kubernetes YAML to framework

## Kustomize to framework

## When and how to use `values-` files.
